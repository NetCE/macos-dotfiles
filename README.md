# Mathias’s MacOS dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first create a branch for yourself, review the code, and edit or remove things you want to be different or don’t want or need at all.

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/code/macos-dotfiles`) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
cd ~/code
git clone git@github.com:NetCE/macos-dotfiles.git
cd ~/code/macos-dotfiles
```

To update your MacOS configuration:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/NetCE/macos-dotfiles.git/tarball/main | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,.osx,LICENSE-MIT.txt}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-L26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new branch

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to start a whole new branch, or to add commands that you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

For example, here is some recommended content for `~/.extra` to set up your Git user environment. This should obviously not be committed to the repository since it is user-specific:

```bash
# Git user config
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Kevin Bluck"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="kevin.bluck@netce.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from the repository. It’s probably better to make a branch instead, though.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
./.macos
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
